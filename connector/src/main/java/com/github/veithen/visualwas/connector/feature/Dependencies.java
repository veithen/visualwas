/**
 * Annotation that declares a dependency on a set of {@link Feature}s. This annotation can be used
 * in the following contexts:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>On another {@link Feature} implementation. These dependencies are resolved by {@link
 *       ConnectorConfiguration.Builder#build()}.
 *   <li>On any class that is used as key in an {@link Attributes} instance. These dependencies are
 *       resolved by {@link ConnectorFactory#createConnector(Endpoint, ConnectorConfiguration,
 *       Attributes)}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * When resolving dependencies, the code checks if a feature of the given type is already present in
 * the connector configuration. If no feature of the given type is found, then the code will attempt
 * to add it to the configuration. This only works if the feature is a singleton. Singleton features
 * are expected to declare a public static final field with name <code>INSTANCE</code> storing a
 * reference to the singleton instance.
