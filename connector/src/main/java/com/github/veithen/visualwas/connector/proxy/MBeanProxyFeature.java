/**
 * Feature that enables the creation of MBean proxies. Proxies can be created in two different ways:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A feature can use {@link MBeanProxyConfigurator#registerProxy(Interface, MBeanLocator)} to
 *       register a proxy. That proxy will be available through {@link Connector#getAdapter(Class)}.
 *       This will create a single proxy instance per connection. This method is typically used for
 *       singleton MBeans.
 *   <li>Application code can use {@link MBeanProxyFactory} (obtained using {@link
 *       Connector#getAdapter(Class)} to create proxies. These proxies are not cached.
 * </ol>
